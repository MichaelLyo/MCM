%摘要
\begin{abstract}

\par For the sake of \textbf{\emph{Measuring the Evolution and Influence in Society's Information Networks}}, our idea is to set up a comprehensive model with plentiful properties of nodes which are consistent with the current states. Therefore, the concept of \textbf{\emph{Complex Network}} is introduced to depict information dissemination vividly. What's more, the \textbf{\emph{Twitter's Network Dataset}} is utilized to verify most of the models we build.


\par About Problem A, in order to \textbf{\emph{Explore the Information Flow}} and \textbf{\emph{Filter out Valuable Information}}, we establish the \textbf{\emph{Information Flow and Filter Model}}. Having considered the diversity in information media, the \textbf{\emph{Flexible Network Structure}} is explored to suit for the various types of information flow. Meanwhile, to gain a better information filter result, we create a filter consisting of ~$6$~ evaluation indexes. After theoretical preparation, we use the \textbf{\emph{Twitter's Network Dataset}} to establish Internet Information Flow and Filter Model for simulation. Finally, the coverage rate of information dissemination is equal to ~$96.7\%$~, after reaching the steady state of information dissemination.


\par As to Problem B \& C, based on the Information Dissemination Model, our assignment is to use the data to verify the \emph{\textbf{Reliability of the Model}} and \emph{\textbf{Predict the Future Data}}. We establish the \emph{\textbf{Network Evolution Model}} to imitate the dynamic network structure in a single medium. The \textbf{\emph{Average Euclidean Distance}} of the \textbf{\emph{real data}} and the \emph{\textbf{predicted data}} is ~$1.784$~, which stands for a good forecast result. After that, we take the model as the basis for the prediction of the Society's Information Network in $2050$. Without considering the emergence of new technologies, the cell phone usage is 51.34\%, which is the highest in the $4$ kinds of media. However, after making bold assumptions that the \emph{\textbf{Quantum Communication}} would be invented in $2035$, the share of the information medium will change dramatically, and the \emph{\textbf{Quantum Communication }} would be the main medium.

\par  When solving the Problem D \& E, we are required to analyze the Public Opinion Dissemination. We divide the network nodes into $3$ types: \textbf{\emph{Individuals, Opinion Leaders and Internet Marketer Group}}. And then we establish the \emph{\textbf{Public Opinion Dissemination Model}} to simulate the real situation of the public opinion dissemination, and draw the contrast curves of public opinion dissemination coverage rate before and after \textbf{\emph{Taking "PUSH" Operation}}. Finally, we screen out the effect factors of public opinion dissemination, and use the example of \textbf{\emph{President Obama's Nearly Opened Twitter}} to verify the stability of the model.


\par The accuracy and stability of our model are proved by simulation using the \emph{\textbf{Twitter's Network Dataset}}. Furthermore, the Information Dissemination Network Model can adapt to different types of media. By slightly adjusting the coefficients, we can apply this network model in various fields of information dissemination.

\subsection{Background}
 
\par Nowadays, with the development of technology and the deterioration of environment, many countries, especially the Uinted States, began to value the clean and renewable energy, such as natural gas and electricity. Meanwhile, traditional energy, such as gasoline and coal, still plays an important role in economics. And it is obvious that the usage of the clean and renewable energy will support the future of mankind.
\par In the United States, an interstate compact is an agreement between two or more states. Frequently, these agreements create a new governmental agency which is responsible for administering or improving some shared resource such as a seaport or public transportation infrastructure.\cite{1} In 1970, the Western Interstate Energy Compact was formed, which was devoted to foster cooperation to develop and manage the nuclear technology. Recently, California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas wish to form a new interstate energy compact focused on increased usage of cleaner, renewable energy sources. 
\par A data file provides 50 years of data in 605 variables on each of these four states' energy production and consumption, along with some demographic and economic information. To inform a set of goals for the new interstate energy compact, we will analysize the data file and model.

\section{Problem A : Energy profile for each of the four states}
\par Factor Analysis is a multivariate statistical analysis method, which is based on the internal dependencies of the correlation matrix of the indicator. It attributes some of the variables that have complex relationship to a few irrelevant factors.\cite{2} We will use this method to deal with problem A in the section.

\subsection{MSN Analysis}
\subsubsection {MSN character analysis}

\par  By observing the given data and acquiring knowledge from reference materials, we can conclude that the MSNs are usually five-character codes, and the three parts of the characters generally represent the following meanings.

\begin{itemize}
    \item First and second characters: describes an energy source (for example, NG for natural gas, MG for motor gasoline);
    \item Third and fourth characters: describes an energy sector or an energy activity (for example, RC for residential consumption, PR for production);
    \item Fifth character: describes a type of data (for example, P for data in physical unit, B for data in billion Btu).	\cite{3}
\end{itemize}

\par As described above, the first part and the second part of the MSN code represent for certain specific meanings. However, in our analysis process, we are more concerned about the general classification of these MSN codes. 

\begin{figure}[h]%[!hptb] 
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./Pic/msn_5.png}
    % 图片标题
    \caption{The meaning of a MSN code, emphasizing the fifth character. Reference \url{https://www.eia.gov/state/seds/sep_use/notes/use_a.pdf}}
    \label{fig:msn_5}  
\end{figure}
\par We also found that the fifth character has six values at most, which can be seen in figure \ref{fig:msn_5}. Thus we start to focus more on the analysis of the fifth character. After comparing the units of the six and calculating, we find the relationship between these six symbols are
\begin{equation}
    B=KP~~~~~,~~~~~V=BD
\end{equation}

\par From the equation we can get the conclusion that B is a key factor between the two equations and can build a connection between them. And we find that all MSNs whose fifth character is B have the same unit Billion Btu, which can be an excellent representative of the MSNs who have the same prefix. So we filter the 605 MSNs and find 215 MSNs' suffix is B. At this stage we have reduced the 605 kinds of MSNs into 215. Every kind of the 215 MSNs contains several MSNs with different suffix but the same prefix.

\subsubsection {MSN classification analysis}

\begin{figure}[!h]%[!hptb] 
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./Pic/classification_by_unit.png}
    % 图片标题
    \caption{Classification by unit in the suffix P.}
    \label{fig:classification_by_unit}  
\end{figure}

\par In order to classify the 215 MSNs more clearly, we look into everyone of the division and find that a large percent of the kinds have the suffix P, which represents the standardized physical units. Physical units naturally represents for the energy classification in the real physical world, and there are mainly 4 kinds of standardized physical units in the data set as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:classification_by_unit}, so it is reasonable to classify the data into 4 groups according to the units.
\par According to the analysis above, we suppose the four units as the following representatives.
Thousand barrels: fule oil
Thouesand short tons: coal coke
Million kilowatthours: electricity
Million cubic feet: natural gas
\par Besides, there are many relationships among MSNs. According to the Formula in the Table A1.Consumption Variables,\cite{4} we remove variables that can be obtained by addition and subtraction of other variables, so that we can avoid the repeat of variables when we calculate the correlation coefficient matrix. 

\subsection{Factor Analysis Model}

\paragraph{Factor loading matrix}
\textrm{\\}
\par By using the data processed, we obtain R, which is the correlation coefficient matrix of natural gas, electricity, fule oil and coal coke.

R666666@

\par We can obtain 
\[
\lambda_1=666, \lambda_2=666, \lambda_3=666, \lambda_4=666,
\]
which are the eigenvalue of R.
\par Meanwhile, we obtain the eigenvector matrix for the eigenvalues of R.

U=666666

\par Simply, the overall percentage and cumulative percentage of eigenvalues are as follows.

666666

\par Therefore, 666. According to assumption 1, the main factors are 666, the corresponding eigenvalues are 666. Then we take out their corresponding eigenvectors from U, and we can obtain the factor loading matrix

A=666

the first row of A is 
666
the second row of A is
666

\paragraph{Factors and weights}
\textrm{\\}
\par According to the factor loading matrix A, we can get the factor analysis model is
666
666
666
666

The definition of the weight of variable is
666\cite{5}

Therefore, we can obtain the the weight of natural gas, electricity, flue oil and coal coke.
\[
w_1=666, w_2=666, w_3=666, w_4=666.
\]

    \label{fig:Information_Disseminate_Crosscutting_Structure_Diagram}  
\end{figure}










\paragraph{Transformation of the states of nodes}
\textrm{\\}
\par In order to study the state changes of the network nodes quantitatively, and analyze the transformation of the network structure with time. We divide the nodes into $4$ classes:

\begin{enumerate}%[(1)]
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\theenumi)}
    \item The nodes in the ~$S$~ state are the nodes which haven't received information yet.
    
    \item The nodes in the ~$I$~ state are the nodes which have received information and can continue to spread it.
    \item The nodes in the ~$IR$~ state are the nodes which have received information and do not spread information at the current time.
    \item The nodes in the ~$R$~ state are the nodes which have received information and cann't continue to spread it.
\end{enumerate}
\emph{Assume that nodes can spread information only one time, that is, after spreading a message, the ~$I$~state of the nodes turn into the ~$R$~ state.
}


\paragraph{The attributes of each part of the network}
\textrm{\\}

\begin{itemize}
\item Network structure attribute: the characteristic attributes of different networks are embodied in the different number of nodes and different number of edges. Node degree is different, resulting in the transmission efficiency of the node is different, the speed of the network is different.
\item Node attribute: the degree of nodes is different, resulting in the probability of the node to receive the message is different, the probability of the spread of the message is also different.
\item Attribute of the information itself: the attribute of information itself is mainly reflected in the importance of the information and the correlation degree of the information.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Example of Information Flow Network Model (Internet)}
\par In order to better explain the theoretical model we have constructed, we build an example model, which takes the Internet as a single media of dissemination.
\paragraph{Construction of realistic network model}
\textrm{\\}
\par After analyzing the theoretical model, we will set up the concrete social's information flow model in Internet.
\par We establish a social network, which is a \textbf{\emph{directed}} graph
\begin{equation}
G_I=(V_I,E_I)~~~~~~~\forall  v_I,u_I\in V_I , \forall e_I=(u_I,v_I)\in E_I
\end{equation}
where ~$v_I$~ and ~$u_I$~ are the nodes of ~$G_I$~, representing the \emph{people or group in society network}. And ~$e_I$~ stands for the edge, representing the \emph{transmission route between people or groups}. Meanwhile, the ~$e_I$~ can also represent that ~$u_I$~ can receive information from ~$v_I$~, the same as ~$u_I\leftarrow v_I$~. We also define ~$\mid V_I\mid$~ as the number of people or groups and ~$\mid E_I\mid$~ as the total number of transmission route.
\par The discrete time series of the node checking information is ~$T_n,n=1,2,3...$~, the probability of ~$Node~i$~ to check information at the moment of ~$T_n$~ is ~$p_{in},i=1,2,3...,\mid V_I\mid$~; ~$p_{in}\in [0,1]$~ is an independent random variable.
\par Assuming that at the moment of ~$T_n$~, the node has received a message, then the probability that information is able to continue to spread is ~$q_{in}$~
\begin{equation}
q_{in}=p_{in} \times [(1-(1-\lambda_{i})^m)/e^{\alpha +\beta}]
\end{equation}

where 
\begin{itemize}
\item ~$\lambda_{i}$~ is influenced by the information attribute factors and the subjective factors of nodes, standing for the probability of node's retransmission or comments after receiving the message.
\item ~$m$~ represents the ~$Node~i$~ has accepted the cumulative number of information at the moment of ~$T_n$~. 
\item ~$\alpha$~ is the cumulative credibility of information sources. ~$\beta$~ is the cumulative number of strong relationship of information sources.
\end{itemize}

\par In the model we have established, the node is human. Under this circumstance, if we need to study node attribute, we have to take into account different types of people. The biggest difference among the different groups is the age structure. Different nodes have different age structures, so there are different node attributes. 



\par We find that not only the attributes of the nodes can affect the propagation of information, but also the properties of the network structure will play a very important role. Different times have different modes of transmission, in the 1870s, newspapers were delivered by trains and stories were passed by telegraph; in the 1970s, when televisions were in most homes; in the 1990s, when households began connecting to the early internet; in the 2010s, when we can carry a connection to the world on our phones. The main difference between different modes of transmission is the spread speed of the media, which can affect the structure of the network. Therefore, we have to take the transmission modes into account. 

\par In this example,the information source is people or groups, spreading the information. The information dissemination has two ways to spread it. One is the \textbf{\emph{interpersonal communication}}, the other is the \textbf{\emph{across-platform communication}}. The former method is oral communication. The latter includes different ways.



\subsection{Information Filter Model}
\par The presence of incorrect and misleading content on the Web can have serious consequences for people who increasingly rely on the internet as their information source for topics such as health, politics, and financial advice\cite{RD}. Under these circumstances, we have to establish a model of information filter to screen for real, valuable messages.
\par In order to solve this problem, we set up an information value evaluation model. The schematic diagram of evaluation index classification is Figure \ref{fig:The_schematic_diagram_of_evaluation_index_classification} as follows.


\begin{figure}[h]%[!hptb] 
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./Pic/The_schematic_diagram_of_evaluation_index_classification.pdf}
    % 图片标题
    \caption{The schematic diagram of evaluation index classification. The center node has 4 screening indexes, each index has different subindexes.}
    \label{fig:The_schematic_diagram_of_evaluation_index_classification}  
\end{figure}

\par After selecting good evaluation indexes, we will quantify the various evaluation indexes to measure the information and screen out the valuable information. The screening index calculation formula is as follows.
\begin{equation}
\omega=e^{-a(t-t_s)}*b _i*b _j*b _k*b_h
\end{equation}
where the ~$b _i,b _j,b _k$~ are the independent random variable, ~$b _i$~ is the relationship degree with current hot spots, the ~$b _j$~ is the degree of public concern about the information, and ~$b _k$~ is the response degree. What's more,~$b_h$~ represents the  information internal factor index. ~$t$~ is the current time, ~$t_s$~ is the release time. ~$a$~ stands for the time factor.
\par The formula above has 4 independent random variables. Because of the absence of specific screening data, we can not make a further analysis of the model. We can only give the preliminary model above.


\subsection{Information Flow and Filter Model Simulation}

\par In the above, we have set up a good information flow and filter model. To verify the reliability of the model, we simulate it.
\subsubsection{Simulation assumptions and data sources}
\par Assumptions are as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item Assuming that the same information is unilaterally circulated, the network model we bulit is directed graph.
\item Our simulation is based on the Twitter's social network, and the data we analyze is the Twitter user's follows data\cite{RB}.
\item Taking into account the convenience of access to the Internet and the rapid transmission of information, we assume that once the users have received a message, they have already obtained the information successfully.
\item Taking into account the \emph{freedom of speech} and \emph{information security} in the United States, in this simulation, we do not consider the feedback role of information filter in information dissemination.
\item We define ~$\lambda_i=1$~.
\end{itemize}




\subsubsection{Simulation process}
\par The process of information flow and filter model simulation as follows.
\begin{enumerate}%[(1)]
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\theenumi)}
    \item Basic preparation and data processing.
    \item According to the discrete time series ~$T_n$~, we evolute the process of information dissemination.
    \item Determine the ~$N_n$~ as the number of nodes that have received information at the moment ~$T_n$~, and the ~$Q_n$~ as the number of nodes that have received information at this time.
    \item We use Twitter 2012's social network data. The data consist of 81306 nodes and 1768149 edges. Through the selection of different information sources, we begin to simulate the process of information dissemination, and use the ~$Q_n$~ to measure the range of information dissemination at different times.
    \item Summary and graphical data results.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Simulation results}

\par After taking simulation, we can obtain some results as follows.


\begin{figure}[h]%[!hptb] 
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=0.53\textwidth]{./Pic/aa_3.jpg}
    % 图片标题
    \caption{The network information diffusion simulation figure. ~$Q$~ is the diffusion ratio. Three curves are included in the graph, respectively, taking the maximum degree nodes, the minimum degree nodes and a node arbitrarily as the information source.}
    \label{fig:aa_3}  
\end{figure}
\par From the Figure \ref{fig:aa_3}, maximum degree node's spread is faster than the other two types of nodes at the beginning of the information spread. Minimum node's diffusion rate is the slowest. Meanwhile, the coverage ratio of the three sources is increasing exponentially in the medium term (about 20 times). After the evolution of about 100 times, the coverage ratio of the three sources tends to grow slowly, eventually approaching 100\%.
\par After analyzing the dissemination characteristics of different information sources, we select the maximum degree node as the information source, analyze it, and make the data we got visualization. The results are in Figure \ref{fig:Social_Network_Information_Dissemination_Simulation_Diagram} as follows.

\begin{figure}[h]%[!hptb] 
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./Pic/Social_Network_Information_Dissemination_Simulation_Diagram.png}
    % 图片标题
    \caption{The social network information dissemination simulation diagram. The subgraph at the top left of the graph is the network structure diagram after the first transmission. The other three subgraph graphs are arranged according to the time of transmission.}
    \label{fig:Social_Network_Information_Dissemination_Simulation_Diagram}  
\end{figure}

\par From the Figure \ref{fig:Social_Network_Information_Dissemination_Simulation_Diagram}, at the beginning of the communication, each node is clearly visible. Since we do not consider the cross transmission of the same message, the message source can only continue to spread the message to the new nodes. This mode of communication will make the information show explosive growth, until all the nodes in the region have been informed. The last subgraph includes many different clusters of different colors and each cluster contains a huge number of nodes. This is the state of the network after the information disseminate reaches steady state.

\par After making information flow and filter model simulation, we verify the reliability of the network model, which has good adaptability and robustness.



\section{Problem B : Profile evolution \& Energy usage comparison among four states}

\par In order to verify our model's reliability, we have to build a short term prediction model to predict the information communication situation for today by using data from the past, and compare them with today's reality.
\subsection{Short Term Prediction Model of Information Dissemination}
\par In this chapter, we first describe the theoretical model of the building, and then build a realistic model of information dissemination.
\subsubsection{Model preparation}
\paragraph{Node distinction}
\text{\\}
\begin{itemize}
\item Isolated node: there is no connection with other nodes at a certain time, and the next moment it may be linked to other nodes in a certain probability.
\item Isolated cluster: there is no connection with other clusters at some point in the next moment, which may be related to other clusters at a certain probability. And there are interconnected nodes in the cluster.
\item Large scale network cluster: cluster network is composed of many nodes or clusters, and there are direct or indirect links between nodes or clusters in the network.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{\emph{Assuming there is no absolute isolated node or cluster, any node or cluster is directly or indirectly connected with other nodes or clusters.}}



\subsubsection{Realistic network model construction}
\par Next, we build the realistic network model by steps.
\paragraph{(1) Constructing a dissemination network}
\text{\\}
\par We define that there are $N_r$ nodes and ~$M_r$~directed edge in the network. Meanwhile, we classify the nodes according to the node's own attribute and introduce the influence factor ~$\gamma _i$~, which would change with the change of the node itself. The ~$\gamma _i$~ represents the new attention degree of a certain node in the unit time ~$\Delta t$~.

\begin{equation}
\gamma _i=\frac{\Delta D_i}{\Delta t}
\end{equation}
\emph{where ~$D_i$~ stands for the degree of Node ~$i$~.}
\paragraph{(2) Adding the new people or group to the network}
\text{\\}
\par In each of the identified time series, the new node has two different ways to join the network.
\par One is establishing the connection relationship with the existing node freely. The probability of being associated with an already existing node is ~$p_i$~,
\begin{equation}
p_i=\frac{D_i+\gamma _i}{{\sum\limits_{i=0}^{N_r}}(D_i+\gamma _i)}
\end{equation}
\par The other is receiving the invitation, in accordance with the principle of common neighbor selection node to establish a connection. After the connection is established, according to the principle of preferential connection, the node will connect with the other nodes. 
\par The probability of connecting with the node ~$i$~ is ~$q_i$~, 
\begin{equation}
q_i=\lambda \beta _i+(1-\lambda ){\frac{{{D_i} + {\lambda _i}}}{{\sum\limits_{i = 0}^{{N_r}} {({D_i} + {\lambda _i})} }}}  
\end{equation}
where ~$\lambda\in {0,1}$~ stands for whether the node is invited. If not, ~$\lambda$~ taken ~$0$~, ~$\beta _i \in [0,1]$~ represents the probability of common adjacent nodes to promote the evolution.

\begin{equation}
\beta_i={\frac{g_{ij}}{G}}
\end{equation}

where ~$g_{ij}$~ stands for the number of having same neighbor between ~$Node~i$~ and ~$Node~j$~; ~$G$~ is the total neighbor number of ~$Node~i$~.
\paragraph{(3) Adding the new relationship to the network}
\text{\\}
\par For the existing nodes in the network, the probability of the link between the two nodes is ~$O_i$~,


\begin{equation}
{O_i} = ({\beta _i} + \frac{{{D_i} + {\lambda _i}}}{{\sum\limits_{i = 0}^{{N_r}} {({D_i} + {\lambda _i})} }})/2
\end{equation}



where ~$\beta_i$~ is the probability of common adjacent nodes to promote the evolution.





\paragraph{(4) Determine the upper limit of the relationship}
\text{\\}
\par Taking into account the actual factors, people's energy is limited. So there is an upper bound on the degree of the node. Before a degree does not reach the ceiling ~$I$~, the broken link probability between nodes is very small.
\par We assume that ~$k$~ is the number of other nodes, which are followed by a certain node. Then the probability of breaking one link is ~$Z_k$~,

\begin{equation}
{Z_k}=1-\lambda \beta _k+(1-\lambda ){\frac{{{D_k} + {\lambda _k}}}{{\sum\limits_{k = 0}^{{N_r}} {({D_k} + {\lambda _k})} }}}=1-q_k
\end{equation}



\paragraph{(5) Calculation of model evaluation index}
\text{\\}
\par In order to network structure, we ought to select several evaluation index. After choosing, the calculation formulas of model evaluation index are as follows:
\begin{equation}
AD=\frac{1}{N}{\sum\limits_{i}^{}}{K_i}
\end{equation}
where the ~$AD$~ stands for the average degree, ~$K$~ is the degree of nodes.
\begin{equation}
L=\frac{1}{n(n-1)}{\sum\limits_{i+1}^{}}{d_{ij}}
\end{equation}
where the ~$L$~ is the average path, $n$ is the number of nodes, and $d_{ij}$ is the shortest distance.
\begin{equation}
C_i=\frac{2l_i}{k_i(k_i-1)}{\sum\limits_{i+1}^{}}{d_{ij}}
\end{equation}
where ~$C_i$~ represents for the average clustering, ~$K_i$~ is the degree of ~$Node~i$~ and ~$l_i$~ is the actual variable between the adjacent points of the ~$Node~i$~.











\subsection{Model Simulation Process}
\par When the initial number of nodes is much smaller than the size of the final network, we are convinced that the number of initial nodes has no influence on the evolution of the network. So we chose the initial number of nodes is ~$3$~, and these ~$3$~ nodes constitute a complete graph. Meanwhile, We define a time period. In this period of time, we will add several nodes to the network randomly (up to no more than 10). The probability of being invited to joining the network and joined the network spontaneously is both 50 percent.
\par After joining the network, the newly added nodes are connected with the nodes which already exist in the network according to the probability of ~$p_1$~ and ~$p_2$~. In each time period, for the nodes which have already existed in the network, connect two unlinked nodes in accordance with the probability of ~$q_1$~, break the edge in accordance with the probability of ~$q_2$~.
\par In order to find the answer, we need to continue fitting and determine the value of ~$p_1, p_2, q_1, q_2$~. For simplicity, we assign fixed values to the ~$p_1$~and ~$p_2$~ after a small range of tests. Futhermore, in the subsequent simulation, the ~$p_1$~and ~$p_2$~ will be considered as fixed values.
\par We select the reference index is the average degree ~$AD$~ of the network, and then use the \textbf{\emph{least squares method}} to take regression analysis, determining the parameters which have the smallest error .
\par The specific process of model simulation is

\begin{enumerate}%[(1)]
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\theenumi)}
    \item In the evolution of the network, when the network evolute to a state where has the same size with the existing referenced network, we mark this time as an observation point. At the end of evolution, we would compare the measured values of these observation points with the actual indicators of the existing reference network, and calculate the \textbf{\emph{square sum of errors}}.
    \item Erase data, and repeat the first step of the experiment 100 times.
    \item After determining the parameters, we would make five simulation in each network size comparison point. And then, make the calculation of the each index to obtain the average value and get the final simulation data.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Forecast \& Validation Results}
\par After the simulation of the model, we have obtained the data, and then compare it with the actual data. The results are as follows.
\subsubsection{Forecast Results}
\par Several results of forecast are listed in the Table \ref{tab:addlabel} as follows.

\begin{table}[htbp]

    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}%
  \label{tab:addlabel}%
\end{table}%
\textbf{\emph{ASPL: average shortest path length}}


\par From the data we obtain above, the \emph{Average Euclidean Distance} is ~$1.784$~. 
\par From Table \ref{tab:addlabel} above, we find that under the condition of having errors, the growth of forecast data is relatively slow. Therefore, we can conclude that in the relatively stable society, the network structure is in the occurrence of slow evolution. Meanwhile, the network model we established can adapt to the change of time.


\subsubsection{Validation Results}

\par The forecast data and the real data comparison chart is drawn in the Figure\ref{fig:P2} as follows.

\begin{figure}[h]%[!hptb]

    \caption{Simulation results and actual data comparison chart. We compare the \textbf{\emph{Average degree, Average clustering and Average shortest path length}}.}
    \label{fig:P2}  
\end{figure}


\par From Figure \ref{fig:P2} above, and compare with the real data, with we can draw the conclusion: Under the condition of having errors, we believe that the simulation data and the real data fitting degree are very high, the changing trends of various indicators are the same. Therefore, as far as we are considered, the model is reliable and can predict the change of network structure in a short time.



\section{Problem C : Long Term Network Evolution Model}
\par The change of information propagation model is divided into the slow change of the short time and the significant change of the long time. If the new revolutionary means of communication would be invited, the information dissemination model will be a complete change. We also need to set up an evolution model to predict the long time changes after the short information transmission is predicted.

\subsection{Model building}
\par In order to measure the change of information media with time, we need to find an index. After analyzing the historical data and the network structure, we define the \textbf{\emph{network dissemination efficiency}} as the main index of the model, meanwhile, analyze it.
\par Through the analysis of the data, we find that in the emergence of new communication media, the usage rate of old communication media will be gradually reduced, but only a few communication media's usage rate tend to be 0, such as the telegraph. The remaining communication media will exist in the society according to a certain proportion, and affect our society in accordance with a certain proportion.
\par In this question, we use the ~$E$~ to represent the dissemination efficiency of the network. 

\begin{equation}
E=\sum a_kE_k 
\end{equation}
where the ~$E_k$~ is the dissemination efficiency of the network of the ~$k^{th}$~ medium.

\subsection{The bold assumption of future communication technology}
\par \textbf{\emph{Innovative ideas require bold assumptions.}}Our analysis of the evolution of information media from 1870s to 2010s found that the emergence of new media will greatly change the pattern of information dissemination. 

\par The following Figure \ref{fig:04} is the timeline of the main information dissemination media changes.
\begin{figure}[h]%[!hptb] 
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{./Pic/04.png}
    % 图片标题
    \caption{The timeline of the main information dissemination media changes}
    \label{fig:04}  
\end{figure}

\par Under these circumstances, we are fully convinced that new information media is likely to be invented before the 2050. After consulting the relevant information\cite{RH}, we found that \textbf{\emph{Quantum Communication}} is likely to go on the stage of history. 

\par The definition of \textbf{\emph{Quantum Communication}} is the high performance communication using the quantum effect under the condition of physical limit. Quantum communication has many advantages as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Quantum cryptography provides a new method for absolutely secure communication.
\item Quantum Communication with good anti-interference does not depend on the transmission medium feature.
\end{itemize}
\par Because quantum communication has so many advantages and its research is also smooth, we boldly assume: before 2050, the quantum communication will come into being. Meanwhile, taking into account the process of quantum communication and the difficulty of commercial use, we assume that in ~$2035$~, the quantum communication will be officially entered the commercial market.




\subsection{Model solving}
\par We collect the data of the proportion of various media frome 1990 to 2015, and bring them into our model to solve. The result are as follows.

\par The lift figure above is the fitting result of date from 1990 to 2015\cite{RK} of the network effciency. The right  pie chart is the proportion of different information dissemination media (around 2050), from which the phone and the internet will become the most popular information dissemination media. Meanwhile, the radio, TVs and newspaper will gradually die out.

Left part chart of the Dashed Line shows the real data collected online, while the right one displays the predicted data. The line which is pointed represents the time that the new technology turning up in the future which tends to influence the society.

\par We use the data obtained from the ITU to predict the condition of information dissemination media in 2050, as the same time, we also get the data verify the reliability of the model. Not only did we obtain the data based on the prediction of the emergence of new technology, but also through access to relevant information, we can boldly gain the date based on have a new technology coming into being. The model is comprehensive and accurate.









\section{Problem D : Public Opinion Dissemination Model}
\par As we all know, information is not a constant when it spreads. Information will be changed with the spread. At the same time of information dissemination, the public opinion will come into being. In this chapter, we will study the mechanism of public opinion dissemination, and establish a model.
\par When constructing the model of public opinion, we believe that different people will have different influence on public opinion. The difference between the first model and this question is: when we construct the first model, we assume that the contribution rate of each node is the same, and the noise of information is not considered in the process of dissemination. However, in this chapter, we construct the network model of public opinion which has different nodes.
\par We can divide the network nodes into the three different types.

\begin{itemize}
\item Individuals: People or group.
\item Opinion Leader: Determine the nature of the event in the network, and predict the future trend of the event.
\item Internet Marketer Group: Internet Marketer Group is a certain scale of the people. They have a certain influence on the event of large-scale nodes in the network. This kind of influence is not related to the distance.
\end{itemize}



\par In a network of public opinion, the schematic map of different typical nodes is as follows.


\begin{figure}[h]%[!hptb] 
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./Pic/Unknown.png}
    % 图片标题
    \caption{Schematic diagram of different typical nodes distribution. The number of \textbf{Individuals} is the biggest, while the number of \textbf{Internet Marketer Groups} is smallest, but its influence is very big. Opinion leaders have a large influence and their quantity is not fixed.}
    \label{fig:Unknown}  
\end{figure}

\par After analyzing the classification of the network nodes, we use the Twitter's data we find to simulate.
\par On the basis of the network established in the first question, we select nodes with maximum degree, and take them as the \textbf{\emph{Internet Marketer Group}}. Meanwhile, we choose the nodes which have the second highest degree as the \textbf{\emph{Opinion Leader}}. We also define the other remaining nodes as the \textbf{\emph{Individuals}}.
\par After defining the nature of the network nodes, we use the \textbf{\emph{Information Network Flow Model}} to simulate this chapter's model.
\par After a period of time, we take the operation of \textbf{\emph{Push}} to network to improve the activity of the network information source, that is, to improve the success rate of information dissemination.
\par The results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:P4} as follows.


\begin{figure}[h]%[!hptb] 
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./Pic/P4.jpg}
    % 图片标题
    \caption{Public opinion diffusion simulation figure.}
    \label{fig:P4}  
\end{figure}

\par In Figure \ref{fig:P4}, after taking operation of \textbf{\emph{Push}}, the message dissemination speed and the efficiency is greatly improved, showing the logistic growth, from which we can find that the operation of the network has a significant impact on the network. \textbf{\emph{Internet Marketer Group}} and \textbf{\emph{Opinion Leaders}} play an important role in the network of public opinion. Therefore, our \textbf{\emph{Public Opinion Dissemination Model}} is reliable and stable.









\section{Problem E : Analyze the Factors that Influence the Public Opinion Dissemination}
\par In the first question, we set up a model of public opinion dissemination. In this chapter, we will analyze the factors that influence the spread of public opinion. At the same time, a real society is analyzed.
\subsection{Influence Factors of Public Opinion Disseminate}
\par There are many factors that affect the spread of public opinion, and we choose the following ~$4$~ factors as the main factors.


\begin{enumerate}%[(1)]
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\theenumi)}
    \item Information value

    The formula for calculating the value of information has been given in the first question. Information value can influence not only the speed of information dissemination, but also the public opinion. value of information is high, the probability of people receiving information and the degree of acceptance will be improved.


    \item People's initial opinions and prejudices

    Psychologists believe that humans are "cognitive misers"\cite{RE}. People always simplify the cognitive process as much as possible. It is very difficult for people to change their ideas once they have produced a view or bias towards an event.
    \item Form and source of information

    The form and source of the information can impact the value of the message, which would also affect the public opinion. The evaluation formula of information's source and form have been given in the previous paper.


    \item Network topology structure and strength

    We will use several indexes of network topology to measure the efficiency of information dissemination
    The topology or strength of the information network in a region, country, or worldwide is depended on the three index: Average Degree ~$AD$~, Average Path Length ~$L$~, and Average Path Length ~$L$~.
\end{enumerate}
\par Taking into account the indexes of the public opinion Dissemination are difficult to be quantified, for simplicity, we do not consider quantitative analysis of the spread of public opinion model, we only evaluate it subjectively.

\subsection{Analysis One Historical Event based on Public Opinion Dissemination Model}
\par In order to express more vivid description of the model we build, we look for a historical event, and analyze the historical events on the basis of our model.



\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering %使得插入的照片居中显示
  \begin{minipage}[t]{.49\linewidth}
   % \framebox{Text}
  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./Pic/obama.png}
  \caption{President Obama gets his own Twitter account.}
  \end{minipage}
  \begin{minipage}[t]{.49\linewidth}
  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./Pic/p5.jpg}
   %\framebox{Text}
  \caption{Graph of President Obama's follower growth.\cite{RG}}
  \label{fig:p5}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
\par "Hello, Twitter! It's Barack. Really! Six years in, they're finally giving me my own account.". After President Obama opened his Facebook account, he opened his Twitter account on May 18, 2015.
\par From Figure \ref{fig:p5}, President Obama's followers has been growing rapidly over time. In our model, President Obama is one of the \textbf{\emph{Opinion Leader}}, the news that he has released is a hot and authoritative topic of concern.
\par The analysis results of this case are very consistent with our expectations, therefore, this example verifies the accuracy of our model.




\section{Strengths and Weaknesses}

\paragraph{Strengths}
\text{\\}
\begin{enumerate}%[(1)]
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\theenumi)}
    \item The information network model established by us has good universality, which is suitable for all kinds of information dissemination media, and has a good time-adaptability.
    \item In our paper, we have simulated the most of the models we have built, and have been optimized to improve the stability and reliability of the model.
    \item There are many different factors that affect the complicated problem. We classify the influencing factors and put forward the quantitative indexes. At the same time, we use of examples to test the quantitative indicators which are screened out. Only in this way, can we select out the well-founded indicators.
\end{enumerate}


\paragraph{Weaknesses}
\begin{enumerate}%[(1)]
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\theenumi)}
    \item We lack the research on the characteristics of the network under different media.
    \item In the \emph{\textbf{information flow and filter network}}, the feedback function of the filter has few descriptions. The noise impact in the process of information dissemination has not been taken into consideration. In addition, the age structure of the node isn't studied in-depthly.
\end{enumerate}
