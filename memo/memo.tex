%	MEMO CONTENT
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\par There are natural gas, electricty, foil oil, and coal coke, which are four kinds of main energy of the four states. In 2009, comparing to other main energy, the importance of the four main energy are very close for California, while the most important energy is electricty and fuel oil has the lowest importance for Texas. For New Mexico, fuel oil also has the lowest importance, while natural gas and coal coke are the most important. And for Arizona, the importance of electricty is the lowest, while the other three kinds of main energy almost have same importance.
\par Besides, in the aspect of renewable energy usage, there are five main sectors. They are transportation, commercial, electric power, industrial and residential. For all of the four states, electric power sector plays the most important role in renewable energy usage, while commercial sector plays the most unimportant role, and each of the other three sectors palys different role for different states.
\par If there are no change of the policy about energy, the total renewable energy usage of California and Texas will be much more than New Mexico and Arizona in 2025 and 2050. However, it is because of the difference of total population of the four states. The per capita renewable energy usage of New Mexico and Arizona will be much more than California and Texas. Besides, the total renewable energy usage of California, Texas, New Mexico will keep growing from 2009 to 2050, while Arizona will keep descending.
\par Based on the prediction of the renewable energy usage, each of the four states should have a goal in 2025 and 2050. For California, Texas, and New Mexico, the goal is that the real total renewable energy usage isn't less than the predicted total renewable energy usage. In order to meet the goal, the three states can take some actions to maintain the current growth trend of the renewable energy usage. However, it is not enough for Arizona. The state should take more positive actions to make the renewable energy usage grow.
