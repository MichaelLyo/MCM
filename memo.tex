\par There are four kinds of mainly used energy in four states, natural gas, electricity, petroleum products and coal, which is determined by their energy usage amount. The usage of these four kinds of energy in different states have different status. The importance of the four are very close for California, while the most important energy is electricty and the most unimportant energy is petroleum for Texas. For New Mexico, petroleum also has the lowest importance, while natural gas and coal are the most important energy. And for Arizona, the importance of electricty is the lowest, while the other three energy almost have same importance.
\par Besides, transportation, commerce, electric power, industry and resident sector are the main sectors where energy be consumed. For all of the four states, electric power sector plays the most important role in REU, while commercial sector plays the most unimportant role. But each of the other three sectors palys different role in different states.
\par If there is no change of the policy about energy, the total REU of California and Texas will be much bigger than New Mexico and Arizona in 2025 and 2050. However, when taking the difference of total population of the four states into consideration, the per capita REU of New Mexico and Arizona will be much bigger than California and Texas. What is important about the trend is that, the total REU of California, Texas and New Mexico will keep growing from 2009 to 2050, while Arizona will keep descending.
\par Based on the prediction of the REU, each of the four states can set up a goal in 2025 and 2050 to make better development in their enconomy. For California, Texas, and New Mexico, the goal can be raising the real total REU more than the predicted total REU. In order to meet the goal, the three states can take some actions to maintain the current growth trend of the REU. However, goals are not that simple for Arizona, since it will have a trend of descending. So Arizona should take more positive actions to make the REU grow, or stop the downward trend at least.
